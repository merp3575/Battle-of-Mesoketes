Problem Statement:

In order to save the country from the attackers, Mesoketes military have decided to build a wall each time when they are beaten by attackers. Because they don’t know the sufficient height of the wall which is enough to defense. So, whenever a side of the wall was attacked successfully, the Wall on that side would be raised to the height sufficient to stop an identical attack in the future. if two or more attacks happened on the exact same day, the Wall was raised only after they all resolved. 

If the wall strength is lower than attacker’s strength, it will be considered as successful attack. But even a successful attack won’t destroy the wall. Here, we have to tell the number successful attacks with the given tribe details. Initially wall sizes are zero. And the city was under attack for a period of 3 days

Example:

Input
Day 1: T1 - N - 3: T2 - S - 4: T3 - W - 2
Day 2: T1 - E - 4: T2 - N - 3: T3 - S - 2
Day 3: T1 - W - 3: T2 - E - 5: T3 - N – 2

Output:

6
